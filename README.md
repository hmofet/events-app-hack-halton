Events app created at 2016 Hack Halton Hackathon


This app pulls information from a Firebase database and shows events from Oakville's recreation centre calendar, and allows users to create custom events that other users of the service can see and visit. The app was created for and presented at the Hack Halton Hackathon at Sheridan College, Oakville Trafalgar campus in Spring 2016.
