# events-app-hack-halton
This app was created in 48 hours using the Ionic Framework as a submission in a hackathon. It is a cross-platform mobile app that uses Firebase as its backend to display events that may be of interest to a citizen of the Halton region. Users can post custom events, and it is prepopulated with Open Data from Oakville's Recreation Centre calendar of classes and events.
